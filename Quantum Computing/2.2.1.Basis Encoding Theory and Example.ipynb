        "\n",
        "Basis encoding is the most basic coding method where classical bits are directly mapped to qubits. A classical bit sequence such as `101` corresponds to qubit states `|1⟩|0⟩|1⟩` in the quantum world.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Technical Details:**\n",
        "  - Classical bits correspond to the states `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.\n",
        "  - Each classical bit is mapped to a single qubit.\n",
        "  - The classical bit sequence is directly encoded as a qubit sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Advantages:**\n",
        "  - **Simple and Understandable:** It is the easiest encoding method to implement and understand. Ideal for training and beginner-level quantum algorithms.\n",
        "  - **Low Computational Requirement:** The encoding process does not require complex calculations and is therefore fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
        "  - **Low Efficiency:** Basis encoding does not increase data density and is therefore inefficient for large datasets.\n",
        "  - **High Qubit Requirement:** Since one qubit is required for each classical bit, it requires a large number of qubits for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Best Use Cases:**\n",
        "  - **Small Data Sets:** Suitable for datasets with a small number of bits.\n",
        "  - **Simple Quantum Algorithms:** Ideal for simple algorithms for learning and training purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Worst Use Cases:**\n",
        "  - **Large Data Sets:** Qubit requirement escalates excessively for datasets containing a large number of bits.\n",
        "  - **Complex Algorithms:** Not suitable for algorithms requiring more complex and efficient encoding methods.\n"
