        "\n",
        "We've discussed multiple times how quantum computing presents a new paradigm that surpasses the limitations of classical computers in solving problems. In this context, we'll examine input encoding, a crucial topic in quantum computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2.2.1. What is Input Encoding?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Input encoding is the process of making classical data processable by a quantum computer. This process involves converting classical information into quantum bits (qubits) and arranging this information in a suitable format for processing in a quantum circuit. Input encoding is the starting point of quantum algorithms, and if not done correctly, it can significantly affect the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.\n",
