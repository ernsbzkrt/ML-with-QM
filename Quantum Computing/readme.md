# 🌌 1. Introduction 🚀

In the second section of our Quantum Computing and Machine Learning study, we will further advance our previous knowledge by discussing how data can be made understandable for Quantum Computers.

# 2. Content 📚

In this section, Introduction to Coding for Quantum Computers is generally explained and examined with examples. This section explores different strategies with detailed explanations of various methods. In this section, theories or methods of Quantum Computing will not be discussed. You can refer to the sections I have previously created for these discussions. Detailed and effective discussions are conducted within the scope of those sections.
