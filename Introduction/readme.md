# 🌌 1. Introduction 🚀

The first topic of our Machine Learning with Quantum Computers study is to revisit the topics we previously discussed at a basic level and delve deeper into them to take a step forward.

# 2. Content 📚

The introduction section delves into the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. It emphasizes the interaction between these two disciplines and highlights the emergence of quantum machine learning. Providing a comprehensive overview, it examines four main intersections and compares fault-tolerant approaches with near-term ones. Subsequently, it elucidates a quantum algorithm for classification with examples.
